# Title-generator

* Motivation: 

Compared with using the original text directly, using a good title can help researchers better search for the paper they need, while at the same time causing less information loss. It also makes the key points of the paper clear at a glance.

Here we use pre-trained Transformer to do text summarization task. 
We developed a dashboard for researchers to utilize our service. It is hosted on Heroku.
When users enter the abstracts, the system will output three titles for selection.



* Responsibilities:

  * Used Transformer for generating titles based on the entered abstracts
  * Pre-processed the data on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and deployed the model on Heroku
  * Collaborated with team members to optimize the model performance
  * Successfully implemented the web application with no prior experience in React and Flask

**Technologies: Python, Heroku, GAE, React, Flask**
